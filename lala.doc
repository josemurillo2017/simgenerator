What If?
A SimGenerator

Project by:
Jenny Xu and Jose Murillo

Goal: What If? A SimGenerator is a game that allows players to experience scenarios such as a zombie apocalypse, war and hunger games-esque world. The player fills out a survey that will be used to generate their character. Then the world will be populated with randomly generated characters (created from the following datasets). The simulation will begin and a PDF will be generated documenting the events that occurred in the scenario.

Data: 
We will be use datasets of answers to personality tests to randomly generate humans that will populate the worlds in our simulation.
Narcissistic Personality Inventory:
 Machiavellianism Test
Consideration of Future Consequences Scale
Experiences in Close Relationship Scale
Cattell’s 16 Personality Factors Test
We plan to combine the data from these five personality tests to create multiple, multi-dimensional individuals that interact with the user’s agent in the game.

Technologies:
Tkinter/Pygame for GUI
Simpy for implementing simulations
Flask for website
AST
